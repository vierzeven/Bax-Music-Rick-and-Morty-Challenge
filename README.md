This project is the result of the **Bax Music Rick and Morty Coding Challenge**, which was sent to me on Wednesday April 13th of 2022, after a very nice first conversation with Zoran Birač and Peter Adkins. 


---------

To get the project up and running, first clone it to your local machine. After that, you can choose one of two routes:

---------

#### The Symfony Route

*For people who have the Symfony Console installed on their system*

1. Step 1 (TBT) 
2. Step 2 (TBT)
3. `symfony server:start -d`

----------

#### The Docker Route

*For people who have Docker Desktop installed on their system*

1. Step 1 (TBT)
2. Step 2 (TBT)
3. `docker-compose build`
4. `docker-compose up -d`
